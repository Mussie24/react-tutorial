# How to Install React â€“ A Step-by-Step Guide
***
React is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build dynamic user interfaces (UIs). You can<br>

use it to build components that represent logically reusable parts of the UI.<br>

Because React is open source, anyone can access its source code, inspect it, modify it, and enhance it 

for their personal needs or app development requirements.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to install React into your project.<br>

Now that you know what React is and why it's useful, you'll learn how to make use of this library in your 

project.

### Step 1: Install Node.js
***
Before you start the React installation process, you must have Node.js installed on your computer. If you do not know what Node.js is all about, you can read more (here, [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-node-js/].)

You have to install Node first because React.js is a JavaScript library, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. So when you're writing React, you include JavaScript functions in your React project, and then Node.js helps run this JavaScript code on the web page.

Node.js has various versions. The recommended version is the latest stable version, as it contains major and significant changes. These changes includes bug fixes and security updates, compatibility with your project dependencies, and so on.

To install Node, navigate to the Node.js website. On their webpage, you have the option to download either the recommended version or the current version, as seen in the image below.
